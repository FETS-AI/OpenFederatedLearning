Configuring the Collaborator
####################

We will show you how to set up |productName| using a simple `MNIST <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database>`_
dataset and a `TensorFlow/Keras <https://www.tensorflow.org/>`_
CNN model as an example.




On each Collaborator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Go through installation and setup (see :ref:`installation_and_setup`), with the following in mind. In this case, we require make install_openfl and make install_openfl_tensorflow. The tensorflow piece is required, as we will be running the models here. The only thing else that is needed for each collaborator are the files already stated that are needed to be copied from the aggregator at it's set up time.
